## Scope

The purpose of this document is to identify specific technical terms (definitions and abbreviations) used within the GSF specifications. Having a common collection of definitions and abbreviations related to the GSF documents will;
- Ensure that the terminology is used in a consistent manner across GSF documents
- Provide the reader a friendly tool explaining the technical terms that are used across multiple documents
- Help the editors in using the terminology in a consistent manner across GSF specifications.

The definitions and abbreviations as given in this document are
- created by the GSF working groups or sub-groups, when the need for precise definition is identified, or
- imported from existing documentation (e.g. ITU, 3GPP, 3GPP2)

### Definitions

| Term | Definition   |
| :------------- | :---------- | 
| **Carbon-aware** | A piece of software or hardware is said to be carbon-aware if it adjusts its behavior (consumption of inputs, processing, or production of outputs) in response to the carbon intensity of the energy it consumes. |
| **Carbon proxy** | Any metric that substitutes in for actual carbon emissions to aid in the measurement of the carbon impact of an entity (e.g. dollar cost of running software in the cloud, run duration of an ML job, etc.) |
| **Carbon-efficient** | A piece of software or hardware is said to be carbon-efficient if it utilizes the minimum possible amount of energy for consumption of inputs, processing, or production of outputs.  |
| **Carbon delta** | Carbon difference between an initial and modified carbon intensity. This is an optional parameter used to capture a "what if", by comparing a real number against another situation. This allows quantification of carbon savings by using the SCI to compare two carbon intensities, and facilitates a singular statement of, "Over X predictions made, users on average reduced their carbon footprint by Z % |
| **Carbon counterfactual** | The carbon delta value had the carbon-aware action been different. | 
| **Carbon transparency** | An entity is said to be carbon-transparent when details about the carbon emissions from its lifecycle are made available to empower the user of that entity to make an informed decision. |
|  **Committee Team** | A group chartered by the Steering Committee to perform specific support tasks.   |
| **Editor(s)**   | A member of a Working Group that is responsible to edit and maintain a document.|
| **Epic**   | It is a component inside of a Work Package. It could be a feature, customer request or business requirement. | 
| **e-Vote**   | Electronic Vote. | 
| **Issue(s)**   | An important topic or problem for debate or discussion. Normally, in GSF Issues are tracked in Github. | 
| **Maintainer**   | A member of the Working Group or GSF staff support that performs maintenance tasks on behalf of the Working Group or Organization. | 
| **Marginal Carbon Intensity**   | This is the emissions intensity of the marginal power plant which will be turned up if you schedule some compute (e.g. increase electricity demand from the grid) at that moment. | 
| **Member(s)**   | A person that belongs to a company that has signed GSF Membership Agreement and Charter(s) and have access to GSF resources. | 
| **Membership Agreement**   | A legal document that provides legal information about rights and obligations of being a member company of GSF. | 
| **Chairs**   | GSF member that has been selected by the Working Group as a coordinator for the Working Group activities. | 
| **Project Charter**   | A legal document that describes the GSF Project. | 
| **Pull Request**   | It indicates what changes are suggested to a branch in a repository on GitHub. | 
| **Release**   | It is the distribution of the final version of a document or application. | 
| **Review & Approval**   | A special process that is used to convey agreement or disagreement on a topic. | 
| **Semantic Versioning**   | It is a versioning scheme to convey backwards or not backwards compatibility of a release. | 
| **Source Code**   | A text listing of commands to be compiled or assembled into an executable computer program. | 
| **Specification(s)**   | An act of describing or identifying something precisely or of stating a precise requirement. | 
| **Steering Committee**   | A committee that decides on the priorities or order of business on GSF. | 
| **Supermajority Vote**   | Extracted from GSF 5.0.1 Member Agreement means an affirmative vote of no less than 3/4 of Steering Members or Working Group Participants, as applicable, that have attended/participated in at least 50% of the last 4 meetings of the group conducting the vote, where each Steering Member or Working Group Participant will receive only 1 vote regardless of how many individuals from that party participate. To ensure the group is capable of making decisions, the voting requirement for attendance/participation of at least 50% of the last 4 meetings shall be waived if there have not yet been 4 meetings. | 
| **Working Group**   | It is a group of experts working together to achieve predefined objectives. The group formalize its objectives and goals in a formal document, the Working Group Charter. | 
| **Working Group Chair**   | A person selected by the Working Group which primary role is to facilitate consensus-building among the group members. | 
| **Working Group Charter**   | A document that contains the scope, objectives, and goals of a particular group. | 
| **Work Package**   | It is a group of related tasks within a project. Each Work Package can be broken down into one or more Epics.|
