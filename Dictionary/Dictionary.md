## Scope

The purpose of this document is to identify specific technical terms (definitions and abbreviations) used within the GSF specifications. Having a common collection of definitions and abbreviations related to the GSF documents will;
- Ensure that the terminology is used in a consistent manner across GSF documents
- Provide the reader a friendly tool explaining the technical terms that are used across multiple documents
- Help the editors in using the terminology in a consistent manner across GSF specifications.

The definitions and abbreviations as given in this document are
- created by the GSF working groups or sub-groups, when the need for precise definition is identified, or
- imported from existing documentation (e.g. ITU, 3GPP, 3GPP2)

## References
### Normative References

```
The policy for reference lists is:
1. GSF documents listed should have at least one approved version – draft-only docs should not be referenced.
Exception exists for documents that will be approved with or after the referenced doc is approved (may be part of same enabler package). In short – approved docs should not reference unapproved docs.
2. When a reference is made to an GSF specification, then Green Software Foundation™ with the TM symbol (™) should
be used in the description.
3. The name + version (no date) for GSF specifications are generally sufficient – dates should be used only if there is a specific reason to limit the usage.
4. References to other affiliate docs should similarly provide sufficient information to uniquely determine the needed document and should provide the appropriate source information.
5. The URL for GSF material (new GSF and affiliate) should always be http://www.[add link].

Models to use:
	[REFLABEL]	<General Model> "Ref Title", Ref information (source, date, id), URL:http//<ref-source>/
	[GSFDOC]	<GSF Model> "GSF Document Title",{ Version x.y,}Green Software Foundation™, GSF <docname>{    <version>}, URL:[ADD HERE]
If there are no entries in the table – enter ‘none’ to be clear.

| **Ability to Act**        | The posession of means or skills by an _agent_ has to take an _action_, which may vary depending on technical aptitude, influence over the software development lifecycle, or control over the hardware selection process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Action**                | An explicit outcome taken, or change avoided, depending on the quantifiable emissions measured by the SCI specification. Actions will generally relate to using less electricity, use electricity more intelligently, or use less hardware.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Activity**              | The operations being instrumented or measured in order to quantify the total carbon emissions of software within the SCI specification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Agent**                 | A person or thing who is empowered to take an _action_, or avoid an _action_ depending on their _degree of freedom_ and _ability to act_.  |  |
| **Carbon counterfactual** | The carbon delta value had the carbon-aware action been different.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Carbon delta**          | The difference in emissions between a carbon-aware action and an action that is not carbon-aware.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Carbon proxy**          | Any metric that substitutes in for actual carbon emissions to aid in the measurement of the carbon impact of an entity (e.g. dollar cost of running software in the cloud, run duration of an ML job, etc.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Carbon transparency**   | An entity is said to be carbon-transparent when details about the carbon emissions from its lifecycle are made available to empower the user of that entity to make an informed decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Carbon-aware**          | A piece of software or hardware is said to be carbon-aware if it adjusts its behavior (consumption of inputs, processing, or production of outputs) in response to the carbon intensity of the energy it consumes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
