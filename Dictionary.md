## Scope

```
Define as it relates to Green Software Foundation (GSF) Activity. If it adds clarity, define what is not in the scope. DELETE THIS COMMENT 
```

## References
### Normative References

```
The policy for reference lists is:
1. GSF documents listed should have at least one approved version – draft-only docs should not be referenced.
Exception exists for documents that will be approved with or after the referenced doc is approved (may be part of same enabler package). In short – approved docs should not reference unapproved docs.
2. When a reference is made to an GSF specification, then Green Software Foundation™ with the TM symbol (™) should 
be used in the description.
3. The name + version (no date) for GSF specifications are generally sufficient – dates should be used only if there is a specific reason to limit the usage.
4. References to other affiliate docs should similarly provide sufficient information to uniquely determine the needed document and should provide the appropriate source information.
5. The URL for GSF material (new GSF and affiliate) should always be http://www.[add link].
    
Models to use:
	[REFLABEL]	<General Model> "Ref Title", Ref information (source, date, id), URL:http//<ref-source>/ 
	[GSFDOC]	<GSF Model> "GSF Document Title",{ Version x.y,}Green Software Foundation™, GSF <docname>{    <version>}, URL:[ADD HERE] 
If there are no entries in the table – enter ‘none’ to be clear.
